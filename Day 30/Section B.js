// 1.Write a callback function using setTimeout that prints a message after 3 seconds?
// Ans: The callback  function runs later and prints a message 
// to the console,showing how asynchronous behaviour works in javascript.


// 2.Convert a callback-based function into a promise?
// Ans:A callback-based function can be converted into a
//  Promise by wrapping it inside new Promise() and calling 
// resolve or reject.


// 3.create a promises that resolves after 2 seconds?
// Ans:This code creates a promises that uses setTimeout to wait for 2 seconds.
// aftre the delay,the promises is resolved,showing how asynchronous task  can be handeled using promises.


// 4.Handle a rejected promise using .catch()?
// Ans:In the code, if the promise encounters a problem 
// and calls reject(), the .catch() block runs and handles
//  that error. This helps in debugging, displaying meaningful
//  error messages, and keeping the application running smoothly. 



// 5.Rewrite a promise example using async/await?
// Ans:Rewriting a promises using async/await makes asynchronous 
// code easier to reads. 


// 6.use try... catch with async/await?
// Ans:The try block runs the async code, and the catch block catches and handles any errors that occur.


// 7.createa function that returns a promise with a random success or failure?
// Ans:A function that returns a promise with rando  success or failure simulates asynchronous behaviour.


// 8.Chain two .then() methods in a promise?
// Ans:Chaining two .then() methods allows the output of one promise handler to be passed to the next.
    // It helps perform sequential asynchronous operations in a clear and ordered manner.



// 9.Create an async function that waits for two promises?
// Ans:An async function can wait for promises using await to pause execution until both are resolved.


// 10.Explain the output of an async function in comments?
// Ans:Comments are used to describe what an async function returns and how await affects the execution flow.
// They explain the resolved value of promises or the error output without changing the program’s behavior.
