    <h2 class="INTERNAL_H2">Kabadii</h2>
    <p class="INTERNAL">
      Kabaddi is a traditional Indian sport that combines strength, strategy, and agility.
      It is played between two teams, where a player called the “raider” runs into the opponent’s half of
      the court, tries to tag as many defenders as possible, and returns to their side without being 
      caught—all in one breath. The defenders aim to stop the raider by tackling or holding them down.
      Kabaddi requires teamwork, quick thinking, and physical endurance. It is very popular in India
      and South Asia and is also played internationally, with leagues like the Pro Kabaddi League 
      helping the game gain global recognition.

    Volleyball is a popular team sport played between two teams of six players each, separated by a high net. The main objective of the game is to send the ball over the net and make it land on the opponent’s court while preventing the same from happening on one’s own side. Players use their hands or arms to hit the ball, and each team is allowed up to three touches before sending the ball back over the net.

    The game was invented in 1895 by William G. Morgan in the United States. Volleyball requires teamwork, coordination, speed, and quick reflexes. It can be played indoors or outdoors, and a famous variation called beach volleyball is played on sand with two players on each side.

    Volleyball is not only a fun recreational game but also an Olympic sport that promotes fitness, cooperation, and sportsmanship among players.
