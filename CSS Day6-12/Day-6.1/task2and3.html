    <h1>SOCIAL</h1>
    <p class="SOCIAL">
    Social life is an important part of human living. It refers to the way people interact, communicate, and build relationships with others in society. Through social activities, people share ideas, help each other, and develop a sense of belonging. Being social helps improve communication skills, teamwork, and understanding among individuals. It also plays a key role in emotional well-being, as it allows people to express themselves and form meaningful connections in their community.
